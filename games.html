                Ever since I made my first game at the beginning of 2022 in CMU's Game Creation Society club, I have
                been
                totally hooked! Game dev combines all of my favorite things:
            <ul>
                <li>Programming/technical problems</li>
                <li>Creativity</li>
                <li>Gaming</li>
                <li>Humor (I particularly like making funny games)</li>
            </ul>
            After college, I intend to continue making games as a hobby and possibly as a side hustle, launching games
            on mobile and hopefully even consoles. My game engine of choice is <a
                href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>
            (which is excellent, so check it out if you wish to make games).

            <p>So far, this is certainly my most technically impressive game yet. I am actually working with CMU math
                professor Dr. David Offner to make this game happen. Underlying enemy AI and automatically generating
                level system is some pretty advanced math, in the realm of graph theory. Most of the mechanics are in
                the game now, so the next steps will be creating tons of smartly designed levels, as well as polishing
                the aesthetic of the game. I hope to release this game on mobile someday, but I will be taking a break
                from the development of the game in 2024 so that I can pursue other projects to learn more about Godot
                in order to make this game the best that it can be.</p>

            <p>Currently, this is probably the most polished and complete game experience I have made yet. While there
                are some minor flaws that could be tweaked, I am very proud of the presentation of the game. I don't
                think that it's balanced very well, but that's okay because Eggbert is just so dang charming. I am most
                proud of the art (done by my amazing girlfriend Alexa) as well as the online leaderboard integration.

                I don't think that I have ever put more effort into anything other than this game, especially during the
                last few weeks of production. To most people, this game is probably so weird, but I just find it
                absolutely hilarious, especially the story. The scope of the game was monsterous, yet I somehow managed
                to finish it within the 15 week semester at CMU. Most of the progress came in the last few weeks, which
                makes it more impressive to me. <br><br>

                I also put a ton of time into thinking up the story of the game. If you want to read the story, I made
                it into a standalone book, which you can read here: <a href="assets/pdf/MAD_RABBITS.pdf">Mad Rabbits:

                This is the first real game I ever made, and there is certainly nothing quite like it. <br><br>

                After a rough first semester of college, I decided to join CMU's Game Creation Society club, as I
                suspected that I would enjoy making games. I had <u>zero</u> prior proper experience making games in an
                engine, yet I had the bright idea to pitch and <u>lead</u> the production of a game, one without a clear
                vision, at that. Fortunately, my team consisted of many skilled individuals, which allowed us to make
                progress while I learned how the heck to make a game.

                I also made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T96Oe09hgQ">trailer</a> for the game on my
                YouTube channel.

            <p>This is technically the first video game I ever made in a video game engine, and it is quite the treat.
                It is made in the PICO-8 engine, and I simply followed a tutorial online to make it (although the amogus
                sprites are my own work).</p>

                While I don't have a playable version of the game anymore or the code, I do have some evidence of its
                existance in my AP Research paper (linked in title). This game was an online multiplayer slide puzzle
                game that I used to test how different types of leaderboards affected performance in a cognitive task. I
                got the code for the game online, then added upon it by integrating Google Sheets using an API to store
                all player data during and after the game. Students then played it during a math class with permission
                from the teacher. In some classes, the game crashed for people, knocking them out of the game one at a
                time, which was honestly kinda funny (in retrospect, I think it had something to do with a quota for API
                read and write calls). Still, I was quite proud that I got a semi-working game with such ambition, and I
                think this was a key moment that solidified my love of making games (although I wouldn't explore it
                further for another year).

            <p>During the 2020 pandemic, I was talking AP Computer Science A, and I was feeling very inspired in going
                10000% above and beyond on my assignments, creating very beautiful and intricate text art graphic output
                for some of my assignments. For whatever reason, on my own time, I felt even more inspired to create a
                chess game that can be played in a Java terminal, which some absolutely insane graphics. Most of the
                chess functionality works, although undoing and redoing doesn't totally work. I still think it is a
                really cool project, especially considering this was one of my pre-game engine "games," which is why I
                want to preserve it on my website. <br><br>

            <p> The very first game I ever made. While I have been unable to find any footage of or code for this game,
                I can provide you with its story. <br><br>

                I was in ninth grade, taking Ms. Lint's Intro to Programming, and in the second half of the year, we
                were taking CMU's CS Academy course to learn programming (after using CMU's Alice during the first
                half). The course was self-paced, but I found programming so fun that I tore through the class at
                lightning speed. Near the end of the year, Ms. Lint told us about a contest CMU CS Academy was holding
                between all schools who participated in the course. I decided to enter the toughest division which
                involved creating a game of some sort. There was no real game engine, but I quickly made a local
                multiplayer game with rudimentary graphics in about a class period or two, which featured two
                characters, each consisting of a circle (representing a head) overtop a rectangle (representing
                shoulders), in a top-down view. Each player could move around using WASD or arrow keys, as well as
                attack using a button, which would make a small, skinny rectangle (representing a sword) appear. To win,
                you needed to strike the opponent with your sword. I didn't think it was that good, but it was kinda fun
                to play, and I actually ended up winning 2nd place at the event (losing to someone who made a Perry the
                Platypus platformer, like how?), which earned me a Kindle Fire 7 as a reward. Even if I put in a ton
                more effort into this game or another, I certainly wouldn't have won, so I am definitely not
                disappointed about 2nd place. Unfortunately, I had no use for the Kindle (it even lagged running 2048),
                so I don't know where it is today. <br><br>

                While the game totally sucked, it was still charming, creative, and fun, which honestly sums up my
                current games today. Because it was my first programmed video game, I will always hold the game and the
                experience dear to my heart. I will never forget the suspenseful excitement watching people test, play,
                and enjoy a game that I made :)
