                Hello, <br><br>

                I'm Dominick Robinson, a junior at Carnegie Mellon University studing Mathematics (concentration in
                Statistics). I am currently interested in pursuing data science, software engineering, or hopefully
                something in the middle. I love to program complex things that do cool things (which is why I love <a
                    href="games.html">making games</a> so much). I also enjoy learning new technologies, because it
                expands my capabilities, which feels good.<br><br>

                Outside of math and programming, I love playing tennis, pickleball, and all other racket sports. I also
                have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DomonationYT">YouTube channel</a> that nowadays mainly serves
                to preserve things that I like to do for others to see. I love trying new things and taking on
                responsibilities, such as serving as Game Creation Society president as well as CMU Pickleball club
                founder and president, which have been incredible opportunities to share some of my biggest passions
                with others. I also like to step outside of my comfort zone, an example of which is my Creative Writing
                minor that I am pursuing. <br><br>

                I hope you enjoy looking through my website as much as I enjoyed making it, and if you would like to
                reach out to me for any reason, please do so at: <a
                    href="mailto:drobinson.lbe@gmail.com">drobinson.lbe@gmail.com</a>.<br><br>

                Thanks and have an amazing day, <br>
                Dominick
