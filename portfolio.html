                While most of my projects to this point have been games, I do not intend to go into the games industry.
                I would rather my main career relate to data science, software engineering, or ideally something in the
                middle. I have a ton of programming experience through games, but I also want to complete practical
                projects to prove that I am capable of the technical jobs which I desire. Throughout my Spring 2024
                semester, I will attempt to complete one project every 1-2 weeks to ensure that I am constantly learning
                career-relevant skills and to flesh out my resume with career-relevant projects.

                I created this project over my winter break to begin a series of statistics projects designed to flesh
                out my portfolio. I really love tennis and its history, which is why I decided to create a dashboard to
                graph the ELO rankings of all tennis players over time (ELO is a metric used to assess performance). I
                also added the feature to omit certain players from history, as tennis fans often discuss what tennis
                history would be like if, say, Federer did not have Nadal to stop him on clay. I am really proud of this
                first statistics project.

                I completed this rather ambitious project back in high school. To summarize, I created an online
                multiplayer slide puzzle game to test if different types of leaderboards and goals (rewards for top 1,
                3, 5, etc.) affected performance in a cognitive task. I used Pygame to make the game, and a Google
                Sheets API to store the data during and after students in various math classes played the game. Many
                students experienced the game crashing (likely due to a read-write quota in the free version). Looking
                back, I also doubt that I got enough data to achieve statistically significant results. Yet, I think
                that the end product was really cool, and was my first time engineering an entire data pipeline.
