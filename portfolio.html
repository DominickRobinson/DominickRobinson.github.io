                As a career, I want to do something that involves statistics, programming, and/or math. Basically,
                problem solving. This section shows some of the projects I've completed that fall into those categories.

                "This study investigates linguistic differences across three generations (Gen Alpha, Gen Z, and
                Millennials) by analyzing Reddit comments. Using metrics such as MATTR, average token
                length, and emoji usage, this study aims to address whether Gen Alpha exhibits a smaller
                vocabulary, uses less sophisticated language, and employs more slang compared to older generations.
                Results revealed statistically significant differences in lexical diversity, with Millennials
                demonstrating the highest diversity and Gen Alpha the lowest. Average token length did not
                differ significantly among generations, suggesting similar linguistic complexity. Emoji usage,
                however, showed a marked generational divide, with Gen Alpha using emojis most frequently
                and Millennials least. Keyness analysis further highlighted generational preferences for words
                and slang, particularly in Gen Alpha, reflecting distinct communication styles. These findings challenge
                the stereotype that Gen Alpha’s vocabulary is inferior, suggesting instead that
                generational differences in language use are more reflective of evolving digital communication
                trends."

                I had a lot of fun with this project. I learned a lot in the class from a great professor that I was
                able to apply in this project, and I was really proud and passionate about the topic I came up with. I
                really enjoyed the process of gathering the data from Reddit. I think that I enjoy setting up data
                pipelines, and it's something I would consider learning more about and going into.

                "Each August, just before the semester begins, Carnegie Mellon’s incoming freshmen arrive on campus
                for their first taste of college life. Many of these students, nervous and inexperienced in managing
                life on their own, require nutritious meals during orientation to fuel them. However, coordinating meals
                for 900 students with varying dietary restrictions is a challenging task that can easily lead to
                overspending and providing unhealthy meal options.

                The goal of our project is to create a list of meals to prepare and the corresponding ingredients to
                buy from local grocers to feed these 900 students during the orientation. This meal plan must meet the
                nutritional constraints while minimizing the cost of the ingredients and ensuring that all students are
                adequately fed. Additionally, our work takes into account students’ dietary restrictions, such as vegan,
                dairy-free, and vegetarian preferences, curating the meal list accordingly."

                My main role on this team was gathering the data. Initially, I gathered all product listings (about
                1000) from Trader Joe's website. However, many products lacked nutritional information. While I was able
                to fill in the missing data with nutrition info from USDA's database, there was ultimately not enough
                data for our project. As a result, I extracted 10,000 products from Whole Foods website, which led to a
                much better solution to the main problem of the paper. Overall, I had a lot of fun gathering the data,
                and I learned many new things in the process.

                I created this project over my winter break to begin a series of statistics projects designed to flesh
                out my portfolio. I really love tennis and its history, which is why I decided to create a dashboard to
                graph the ELO rankings of all tennis players over time (ELO is a metric used to assess performance). I
                also added the feature to omit certain players from history, as tennis fans often discuss what tennis
                history would be like if, say, Federer did not have Nadal to stop him on clay. I am really proud of this
                first statistics project.

                I completed this rather ambitious project back in high school. To summarize, I created an online
                multiplayer slide puzzle game to test if different types of leaderboards and goals (rewards for top 1,
                3, 5, etc.) affected performance in a cognitive task. I used Pygame to make the game, and a Google
                Sheets API to store the data during and after students in various math classes played the game. Many
                students experienced the game crashing (likely due to a read-write quota in the free version). Looking
                back, I also doubt that I got enough data to achieve statistically significant results. Yet, I think
                that the end product was really cool, and was my first time engineering an entire data pipeline.
