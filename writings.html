                In addition to my Mathematics major, I am also pursuing a Creative Writing minor. To be totally honest,
                my main reason for pursuing the minor was because the minor is relatively short, and the classes
                required nicely covered my weird gen-ed requirements. It's basically a free minor. However, I am
                extremely grateful for having taking this track, as I have produced many works that I am very proud of.
                Much like the games I have made, these works may not be extremely complex or especially polished, but
                I think that they are really funny, so I love them anyways.

                CMU Pickleball had a sizzling summer in 2023 as they earned 5 medals in various events, so I just had to
                create another article for <i>The Tartan</i> to commemorate it.

                I wrote this article for the school newspaper <i>The Tartan</i> to commemorate CMU Pickleball's
                first-ever match against another school. While we got smoked, it was still a lot of fun. This article
                also granted me the position of "Junior Staffwriter."

                I wrote this screenplay for my "Intro to Screenwriting" class with Melissa Martin. I plan to adapt this
                into a YouTube series one day, as I wrote this with the intent to do so. I would like to revise the
                ending though, since I did not know how to end the story with a well-earned payoff.

                Not only is Mad Rabbits a game, but it's also a book! This story is a work of pure, Shakespearean art.
                This masterpiece will enlighten you. You will not be the same. Read it if you want to live a fulfilling

                While not the funniest thing I've ever written, this piece is why I pursued a Creative Writing minor. My
                professor enjoyed the humor of my work, my transformation of a typical college essay into entertainment,
                and suggested that I pursue a Creative Writing minor, so I looked into it and said "why not?" <br><br>

                This paper was written for a required first-year writing course called "Writing about Public Problems,"
                and I decided to write about a mundane local issue instead of a greater societal issue that I would not
                have had any real authority over. My mom loves this paper.
